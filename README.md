## About the Video Course
TypeScript’s popularity seems to only increase since it’s being adopted by popular frameworks such as Angular. Optional typing seems like a feature coming to your favorite dynamically typed language soon too. Not only is it a good time to learn JavaScript, but it’s also a good time to get acquainted with TypeScript too.
This step-by-step guide will get you started with TypeScript with the help of practical examples. You’ll start off by installing TypeScript and its compiler, then you’ll get familiar with the TypeScript architecture, where we’ll look at design goals and language components. Following this, you’ll explore the runtime. Next, you’ll be introduced to functional programming with TypeScript and will dive into asynchronous programming principles. 
Moving on, you’ll get to know about various functions, its declarations, expressions, and more. We’ll explore callbacks and arrow functions, then you’ll create higher-order functions and at the end, you will explore promises and generators. After this, we’ll explain object-oriented features in detail, where you’ll dive into classes. Following this, you’ll explore interfaces and generics which make the code reusable. You’ll learn to organize the code using Namespaces and you’ll understand modules. 
By the end of this course, you will have learned enough to implement all the concepts with the latest features of TypeScript to build to-do applications from scratch.
